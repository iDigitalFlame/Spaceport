# The Spaceport System Management Daemon (SMD)

This is the configuration for my personal Archlinux notebook, dubbed "spaceport".

This repository includes many files used in the configuration of the operating system and
other installed packages. (Listed in packages.md)

The System Management Daemon (SMD) is a system that allows for management of many system-level components.
Including brightness, networking, bluetooth, wireless, sleep, cpu and virtual machines.
SMD is located in usr/lib and can be invoked from the bin and usr/lib/libexec directories.
